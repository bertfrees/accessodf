description_E_HeadingInFrame=The heading is placed inside a frame.
description_E_HeadingInSection=A heading is placed inside a section
description_E_NoLanguage=The language of a span of text is set to "None". Screen readers and text-to-speech software need to know the language in order to convert the text to speech.
description_E_NoDefaultLanguage=The document has no default language. Screen readers and other text-to-speech systems need to know the default language of the document. 
description_E_NoHyperlinkLanguage=The language of a hyperlink is set to "None". Screen readers and text-to-speech software need to know the language in order to convert the text to speech.
description_E_UnsupportedImageFormat=The image is not in a format supported by DAISY. Only PNG and JPG images are excepted.
description_E_ImageAnchorFloat=The image anchor is not set to "As Character".
description_A_NoTitle=The document has no title.
description_A_NoHeadings=The document contains no headings. Headings help readers navigate the parts, chapters and/or sections in a document.
description_A_NoSubtitle=The document may need a subtitle.
description_A_AlternateLevel=The document uses more than 6 levels of headings. The heading structure will not be adopted completely in HTML and DAISY if no special precautions are taken.
description_A_FakeUnorderedList=The document contains content that visually looks like a list but that does not use proper lists styles.
description_A_FakeOrderedList=The document contains content that visually looks like a numbered list but that does not use proper lists styles.

description_A_LinkedImage=The image is linked to the document instead of being embedded.
description_A_ImageWithoutAlt=The image has no text alternative (Title and/or Description). A text alternative ensures that the information conveyed by the image is also available to people who cannot see.
description_A_ObjectWithoutAlt=The object has no text alternative (Title and/or Description). A text alternative makes sure that the information conveyed by the object is also available to people who cannot see.
description_A_FormulaWithoutAlt=The formula has no text alternative (Title and/or Description). A text alternative makes sure that the information conveyed by the formula is also available to people who cannot see.
description_A_FakeTable=Text has been formatted to look like a table using the space bar and/or the Tab key. Although it looks like a table visually, it is not recognized as a table by screen readers or other assistive technologies.
description_A_MergedCells=The table contains merged cells, which makes it more difficult for screen reader users to understand the table. Merged cells also create problems for conversion to DAISY or Braille.
description_A_NestedTable=There is a table inside another table. Nested tables are difficult to navigate for screen reader users.
description_A_NoTableHeading=The headings in this table are not properly identified. Table headings allow screen readers to associate table cells with the appropriate headings.

description_A_BigTable=This table is very long and therefore difficult to use for blind users.
description_A_CaptionBelowBigTable=The caption is below the table. Placing the caption above a long table helps users, especially blind users, decide whether they want to read the table or skip it.

description_A_LowContrast=The contrast between back- and forground colours is too low. A document with low contrast can be difficult to read, especially for people with low vision.
description_A_FakeText=Special characters are faked by applying a special font to normal text. 
description_A_JustifiedText=Text is justified. Justified type can make your text look distorted and hard to read because of gaping holes (rivers of whitespace) between words.
description_A_SmallText=The font size in this paragraph or span of text is very small. Small text can be difficult to read.
description_A_FlashText=This span of text uses a blinking font effect. Blinking content can be distracting for certain people, especially those with attention deficit disorders (ADD).

description_A_FakeQuote=Text has been formatted to look like a quote without using a quotation style.
description_A_NoHyperlinkText=The text of this link does not identify the link's purpose, so it does not help people decide whether they want to follow the link. A URL is not considered as meaningful link text.

suggestion_E_ManyTitles=A document should have a single title. If you are combining several documents into a single file, consider splitting the file into one file per document. If one or more titles in the document are subtitles (right below the main title), mark them with the Subtitle style.
suggestion_E_EmptyTitle=If an empty title is not meant to be a title but, for instance, only serves for spacing above the actual title, select "Clear formatting" from the styles drop-down list or delete it.
suggestion_E_EmptyHeading=Each heading needs to contain informative content that describes the topic or purpose. This enables users to navigate or search by headings. Use Heading styles to identify headings in a way that represents the structure of the document. If an empty headings is not meant to be a heading, select "Clear formatting" from the style menu and/or delete it.
suggestion_E_HeadingSkip=Chapter headings should represent the structure of the document and not skip levels. In other words, a Heading level 1 should not be followed by a Heading level 3 but by a Heading level 2, etcetera. If the current heading styles were chosen for visual reasons (size, font type, etcetera), modify the visual properties of the heading styles after correcting the heading levels.


suggestion_E_NoLanguage=You can set the language by selecting the text and going through the menu items Tools > Language > For Selection and selecting the language you use in the selected text.
suggestion_E_NoDefaultLanguage=You can set the language by going through the menu items Tools > Language > For all Text and selecting the language you use in the document.
suggestion_E_NoHyperlinkLanguage=You can set the language by selecting the hyperlink and going through the menu items Tools > Language > For Selection and selecting the language you use in the link text. You can also set the language for all current and future hyperlinks by modifying the style "Internet Link". To modify this style, open the "Styles and Formatting" panel (F11) and select the "Character Styles" (second button in the top left corner). Open the Character Style dialog by a right click or Shift+F10 on the style "Internet Link" and choosing Modify. Go to the Font tab, then to Language selection list, and select the language that you use for most of the links in the document. Close the dialog with the OK button.
suggestion_E_UnsupportedImageFormat=The document contains one or more images in formats other than PNG or JPEG (JPG). If you plan to export to digital talking books in the DAISY format, you need to replace images in formats such as BMP, GIF and TIFF with either PNG or JPEG/JPG.
suggestion_E_ImageAnchorFloat=Change the image anchor to "As Character": right-click on the image, select Anchor and choose the option "As Character." If the anchor is not set to this value, the image is difficult to select with the keyboard.\nNote: OpenOffice.org 3.2 and older versions have a bug that deletes an image\u2019s text alternatives (Title and Description) if the anchor is modified. To avoid this, the text alternatives should be added after modifying the anchor.
suggestion_A_NoTitle=Provide a title for the document if this type of document typically has a title. Either identify the text you provided as a title and mark it with the Title style, or add a meaningful title and mark it with the Title style.
suggestion_A_NoHeadings=Give each part, chapter or section of the document a heading that captures the essence of the topic. Use Heading styles to identify headings in a way that represents the structure of the document. However, if you are writing a type of document that does not require headings (e.g. a letter), you can ignore this alert.
suggestion_A_NoSubtitle=If the text immediately below the Title was meant to be a subtitle, please mark it with the Subtitle style.
suggestion_A_AlternateLevel=If it is not absolutely necessary, try to avoid using more than 6 levels of headings. When exporting to DAISY, you can activate the "alternative markup of levels" option.
suggestion_A_FakeUnorderedList=Faked lists should be avoided at all cost. Instead of imitating a list structure with manually entered bullets, spaces and tabs, you should create lists in the standard way, i.e. by using List styles.
suggestion_A_FakeOrderedList=Faked lists should be avoided at all cost. Instead of imitating a list structure with manually entered numbers, spaces and tabs, you should create lists in the standard way, i.e. by using List (numbering) styles.

suggestion_A_LinkedImage=When inserting an image into a document, embed the graphic file (save a copy in the document) instead of linking it (only include a reference to the file), to prevent images from becoming inaccessible because of broken links.
suggestion_A_ImageWithoutAlt=To define a title and a description for an image, go to Format > Object > Description. The description should contain the same essential information as the image. An image that is purely decorative does not need alternative text.\nNote: OpenOffice.org 3.2 and older versions have a bug that deletes an image's text alternatives if the anchor is modified or when a caption is added. To avoid this, the text alternatives should be added after modifying the anchor or after adding a caption.
suggestion_A_ObjectWithoutAlt=To define a title and a description for an object, go to [Format > Object > Description]. The description should contain the same essential information as the object.
suggestion_A_FormulaWithoutAlt=To define a title and a description for a formula, go to [Format > Object > Description]. The description should contain the same essential information as the formula.
suggestion_A_FakeTable=Use only "real tables" to present tabular information. Go to Insert > Table or press Crtl+F12 to create a real table and organize the information in rows and columns.
suggestion_A_MergedCells=Wherever possible, keep tables simple by avoiding merged cells.
suggestion_A_NestedTable=Simplify the table. If possible, divide the table into separate smaller tables.
suggestion_A_NoTableHeading=If the first row or rows are meant to be table headings, make sure that this row (or rows) has the style "Table Heading" and the headings are repeatable. To make the headings repeatable, go to Table > Table Properties > Text Flow, check "Repeat Heading" and identify the appropriate number of rows. 
suggestion_A_BreakRows=To disable page breaks inside rows, go to Table > Table Properties > Text Flow and uncheck the checkbox "Allow row to break across pages and columns."
suggestion_A_BigTable=If possible, split very long tables into smaller ones.
suggestion_A_CaptionBelowBigTable=If tables are very long, it is better to place table captions at the top.
suggestion_A_UnidentifiedLanguage=You can set the language for a paragraph or selection by going through the menu items Tools > Language > For Selection or Tools > Language > For Paragraph.
suggestion_A_LowContrast=Try to maximize the contrast between text and background.
suggestion_A_FakeText=Don't fake special characters (foreign language characters, mathematical symbols, \u2026) by applying specialised fonts for foreign alphabets or fonts like Dingbats or Symbol. Instead, use the proper Unicode representations of these characters.
suggestion_A_JustifiedText=Always left align text, or right align for right-to-left languages.
suggestion_A_SmallText=To enlarge the font size, you can modify the text style or modify the formatting of the text directly. To modify the text style, open the Styles and Formatting panel (press F11), identify the current style, right-click the style, select Modify, go to Font and set a bigger font size. To modify the text formatting directly, select the text that needs to be modified, right-click on the selection, go to Size and select a bigger font size.
suggestion_A_FlashText=Remove the blinking effect by using normal text, bold text, colour (use sufficient contrast between text and background) or a combination of these features.
suggestion_A_AllCaps=Avoid writing text in all caps. If needed, use normal text and style it as all caps text. You can do this by going to "Format > Characters > Font Effects" and selecting the Capitals or Small capitals effect.
suggestion_A_LongUnderline=Avoid using underlining to distinguish certain words from others, especially for long spans of text. Using bold face or a combination of bold and italics is preferred.
suggestion_A_LongItalic=Avoid italics for long spans of text. Using bold face is preferred.
suggestion_A_EmptyTitleField=You can define a title for your document in File > Properties > Description.
suggestion_A_FakeHeading=If the big or bold text is meant to be a heading, clear the formatting by selecting "Clear formatting" in the styles drop-down list and turn the content into a heading by selecting the proper heading style (Heading 1, Heading 2, etcetera) from the styles drop-down list.
suggestion_A_FakeQuote=If the indented text is meant to be a quote, apply the Quotations style (from the styles drop-down list) to the content.
suggestion_A_NoHyperlinkText=Make the link text as meaningful as possible, for example by using the title of the referenced document. If URLs need to be readable in a printed version of the document, you can use a footnote or an endnote that contains the URL. In that case, make sure that the link cannot be activated (i.e. that it is not clickable).
